# foponts project TODO list

Here is a list of TODO items that are nice to add to the current foponts project:

- [ ] Include Windows-specific information on installing foponts on a Windows-based machines.
- [ ] Add an MD5sums to all downloaded artifacts and add an appropriate info on it in [README](README.md).
- [ ] Add a troubleshooting section in [README](README.md).
- [ ] Add a fonts mapping logic diagram, explaining how foponts maps fonts/glyphs on the long way of `xsl:fo` > `.fo` > `.pdf` and why it is always better to use font families in `xsl:fo` rather than a certain fonts names/glyphs.
- [ ] Add small text file within the downloaded archive to point to the current project on github.
